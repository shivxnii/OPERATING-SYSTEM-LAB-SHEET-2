# ENCS351 - Lab 2: System Startup, Process Creation & Termination Simulation

## Objective
To simulate system startup, process creation, execution, and termination using Python. This lab demonstrates how an operating system manages multiple processes and logs their lifecycle events.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- multiprocessing
- logging
- time

## Implementation Details
1. Configured logging to record timestamped process activity in `process_log.txt`.
2. Defined a function `system_process()` to simulate a dummy task (2-second sleep).
3. Created two processes using `multiprocessing.Process()`.
4. Used `.start()` to initiate and `.join()` to ensure graceful termination.
5. Verified results in log file.

## Sample Output
**Console:**
```
System Starting...
System Shutdown.
```

**process_log.txt:**
```
2025-07-16 12:35:21,005 - Process-1 - Process-1 started
2025-07-16 12:35:21,006 - Process-2 - Process-2 started
2025-07-16 12:35:23,007 - Process-1 - Process-1 ended
2025-07-16 12:35:23,008 - Process-2 - Process-2 ended
```

## Observations
- Both processes run concurrently and finish around the same time.
- The log file confirms start and end timestamps for each process.
- Joining ensures all processes terminate before system shutdown.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — linear with number of processes.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — due to process objects and logs.

## Conclusion
This lab effectively simulates basic OS process handling. The use of `multiprocessing` and `logging` modules provides a clear, real-world demonstration of concurrent process behavior in a system startup scenario.
